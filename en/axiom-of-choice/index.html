Axiom of Choice

<div class="abstract">
<p>The Axiom of Choice (AC) lies at the heart of the foundations of mathematics. One one hand, several classic theorems, as beautiful as they are useful, require AC. On the other hand, AC allow the construction of mathematical monsters, as unwelcome as they are uneeded. This conumdrum is unvoidable: we cannot have the light without the darkness. This article will start with a gentle introduction, giving an overview of the key theorems, and discussing some philosophical implications. Then I will demonstrate some of the simpler results.</p>


</div>
<div id="just-after-abstract"></div>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A naive statement of AC is that, given a family of non-empty disjoint sets, one can choose an element in each set. By that I mean one doesn’t provide a method to construct that element. One just says: I choose an element in the set under consideration, and then I carry on the demonstration with that element. This is consequential a statement only for infinite enough sets. First, choosing an element in a finite set is a non-issue, in the sense that no counter-intuitive results can be built based on the ability to make such choices at will. Being able to choose an integer is not problematic either, it turns out. There is an infinite number of them but it is too small an infinite: between any two integers, there is only a finite number of integers. By extension, any set whose elements can be counted with integers is a non-issue too. That famously includes rational numbers. AC starts to have meaningful consequences for sets such as the real numbers <script type="math/tex">\begin{equation}
\reals
\end{equation}</script>, that is to say for the cardinal of the continuum: any bounded interval of real numbers can be put in one-to-one correspondance with the entire set of real numbers, clearly showing how much bigger an infinite they represent compared to integers. A more precise definition of AC will be given later but this simple one will suffice in this introduction.</p>

<p>One can add AC to the foundation of set theory, on which the rest of math is built, leading to the so-called ZFC framework, for Zermelo, Fraenkel, and Choice! Or one can refuse to use AC, leading to half a dozen different set theories. It should be noted that ZFC is the de facto standard of mainstream mathematics. Most undergraduate students will take for granted all the theorems I am going to mention which require AC to be demonstrated.</p>

<p>The first point is that, with AC, one can create «several dreadful monstrosities — unwelcome and unneeded» as stated by <a href="#Herrlich:2006aa" class="bibliography-reference"> Herrlich (2006)</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Among them, functions taking finite values with a host of weird properties. First, these monsters cannot be integrated on any finite interval, not even by the most powerful notion of integration available, devised by Lebesgue in the early 20th century. Let me emphasise that, since I consider finite intervals and functions taking finite values, the problem is not of divergent integrals: those are not even defined. Then, the graph of such a monster is dense in the plane <script type="math/tex">\begin{equation}
\reals^2
\end{equation}</script>: this means that, given any point <script type="math/tex">\begin{equation}
P
\end{equation}</script>, the graph passes as close as one desires to <script type="math/tex">\begin{equation}
P
\end{equation}</script>. Worse, there are infinitely many more such monsters than well-behaved functions.</p>

<p>AC also makes possible the Banach-Tarsky decomposition. That one is particularly counter-intuitive: consider a sphere of radius 1; then there is a way to decompose it in a finite number of parts, and then to move the parts to make two spheres of radius 1. In mathematics, “move” means translating, rotating or flipping, i.e. no change of volume or shape (although for such monsters as those parts need to be, shape is pretty meaningless a word). The paradox here is of course that motions do not change volumes but that they result in doubling the volume of the original sphere.</p>

<p>It should be pointed out that it is not just that such monsters can be constructed with AC: without AC, one can build frameworks in which those monsters cannot exist. No Banach-Tarsky theorem, and none of those monster functions whose graph fill the entire plane. One might therefore conclude that we need to ditch AC. Unfortunately there are several beautiful theorems which cannot be demonstrated anymore. With AC, every vector space has a base. All bases have the same cardinal, which allows to define the dimension of a vector space. AC also allow the demonstration of essential theorems in the topology of real numbers. For example, every accumulation point of a set of reals can be reached by a converging sequence of elements of the said set: this is key to the rigorous development of calculus. These results cannot be demonstrated without AC. I.e. there are systems without AC where one can build counter-examples.</p>

<p>There is therefore no escape: with AC, disasters. Without AC, disasters.</p>
