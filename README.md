# blog

The blog is built with the framework in my repository nanoc-science, using the content from the repositories blog-fr and blog-en. The site is thus divided into a French section and an English section, respectively at http://luc-j-bourhis.github.io/blog/fr/ and at http://luc-j-bourhis.github.io/blog/en/.
